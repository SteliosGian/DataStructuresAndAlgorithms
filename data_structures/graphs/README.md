# Graphs

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices (V) and a set of edges (E). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).

## Types of Graphs

### Directed

A Directed Graph is defined as a type of graph where the edges have a direction associated with them.

### Undirected

An Undirected Graph is defined as a type of graph where the edges **don't** have a direction associated with them.

### Weighted

A Weighted Graph is a special type of graph in which the edges are assigned some weights which represent cost, distance and many other relative measuring units.

### Unweighted

An Unweighted Graph doesn't have assigned weights to its edges.

### Cyclic

A Cyclic Graph is defined as a graph that contains at least one cycle which is a path that begins and ends at the same node, without passing through any other node twice.

### Acyclic

An Acyclic Graph doesn't contain cycles.

## Pros & Cons

### Pros

* Relationships

### Cons
