# Sorting

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.


## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort repeatedly swaps the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

**Time Complexity** --> O(n^2)  
**Space Complexity** --> O(1)

## Selection Sort

Selection Sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list.

**Time Complexity** --> O(n^2)  
**Space Complexity** --> O(1)

## Insertion Sort

In Insertion Sort, the array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
It is used then the list is almost/nearly sorted.

**Time Complexity** --> O(n^2)  
**Space Complexity** --> O(1)

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort works by dividing an array into smaller subarrays, sorting each subarray, and then merging the sorted subarrays back together to form the final sorted array.

**Time Complexity** --> O(n log n)  
**Space Complexity** --> O(n)
