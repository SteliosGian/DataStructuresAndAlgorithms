# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique using caching.

## Memoization - Caching

Caching - a way to store values so they can be used later.  
Memoization is used to speed up computer programs by eliminating the repetitive computation of results, and by avoiding repeated calls to functions that process the same input.

## When to use Dynamic Programming

1. Can be divided into subproblem
2. Recursive solution
3. Are there repetitive subproblems
4. Memoize subproblems
